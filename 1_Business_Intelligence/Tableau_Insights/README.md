# Insurance Claim Analysis, Tableau Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project studies car insurance claim data to find patterns and insights that can help insurance companies improve pricing and risk management strategies. The goal is to understand which customer groups are more or less likely to make claims based on factors like income, education, vehicle type, gender, and other demographics.

## Business Context
Accidents happen for various reasons, such as driver behavior, road conditions, or vehicle type. For insurance companies, understanding these factors is crucial to:

- Estimate potential financial risks  
- Adjust premium rates fairly  
- Design data-driven, customer-focused insurance policies  
I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize these insights and support decision-making.

## Objectives
- Explore and analyze insurance claim data  
- Visualize customer demographics and claim trends  
- Identify risk patterns and recommend policy adjustments  
- Present findings in an interactive Tableau storyboard  

## Key Insights
- High-income customers are less likely to file claims, which indicates potential for loyalty or premium offers.  
- Customers with higher education levels have lower claim frequencies.  
- Medium-term plans (8 to 15 years) have stable claim rates, making them ideal for pricing.  
- Minivans are linked to the lowest claim risk.  
- Female customers show moderate claim frequencies, indicating balanced risk.  

## Tools and Technologies
- Tableau Public  
- Tableau Prep (for data cleaning and transformation)  
- Car Insurance Claims Dataset (open-source)  

## Recommendations
- Offer premium plans or loyalty benefits to high-income groups.  
- Focus on medium-term plans for better claim predictability.  
- Adjust premiums based on vehicle type and education level.  
- Run awareness programs targeting higher-risk segments.
